# Create: Fully Loaded

This is effectively a personal fork of the popular 
[Create & Explore](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-explore-c-e)
modpack, updated to include some interesting Create addons.

## Differences from C&E (so far)

- Switched from Fabric to NeoForge
- Simple Voice Chat

## Releases

Each tagged commit creates a release with the attached CurseForge formatted
zip archive of the modpack. All launchers capable of importing CurseForge mods 
and modpacks should be capable of importing this file.

## Repository Contents

This modpack is maintained and versioned with 
[packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz), a cli tool for managing modpack
dependencies in a structured way. Currently depends on a custom build of packwiz
due to [this issue](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz/issues/295) with 
NeoForge exports.
